# My Blog in Umbraco

This is the umbraco installation for my blog, it is setup using SQL CE but the sdf file is not included. It is a work in progress while I port the 4.something version over to 6.1.2.

I'm still trying to work out if I actually need the umbraco files and NuGet should re-install those anyway...
